# üê∏ ving

![](./assets/screenshot.png)

`ving` is a visualization ping utility written in Golang(1.11+).
Special thanks to the amazing [termui](https://github.com/gizak/termui) library.

# ü¶Å Features

* ping multiple targets concurrently and independently;
* trace a target like a simple `tracerout`, `--trace`;
* probe well known tcp ports, `--ports`;
* error rate and latency statistics in sliding window, as emoji;
* sort by error rate and latency statistic, `--sort`;
* ping gateway conveniently, `-g`;
* responsive terminal display (based on termui).

## Feature details

### trace

toggle by tapping <kbd>t</kbd> and use <kbd>‚ñ≤</kbd> / <kbd>‚ñº</kbd> to choose then <kbd>enter</kbd> to begin a trace.

By default, `ving` will trace a target automatically per 500ms along with the TTL increase until it touches the target, then begin another round trace.
You can enable trace manually by tapping <kbd>n</kbd>, and each following tapping <kbd>n</kbd> will increase ttl and do a single probe.
Absolutely, you can also recover to automatic mode by tapping <kbd>c</kbd>.

### ports probe

toggle by tapping <kbd>p</kbd> and use <kbd>‚ñ≤</kbd> / <kbd>‚ñº</kbd> to choose then <kbd>enter</kbd> to begin port probe.

Tapping <kbd>v</kbd> will change the port view: name, port number, or all.
Tapping <kbd>r</kbd> will refresh touch result and touch again from begin.
